Welcome to TaskBuster's documentation!
======================================

This is an awesome **Django Project Boilerplate**!!

With this code you can start a *complex* Django Project
very quickly, with just a few steps!

Some of the TaskBuster Django Project Boilerplate functionalities are:

- **different virtual environments** for developing, testing and production
- **Internationalization** and **localization** to support different languages
- Project structure
- **HTML5 Boilerplate**
- Template Inheritance
- Functional **tests**
- robots.txt and humans.txt configured

Moreover, you can learn how to create this boilerplate **step by step**
in the |taskbuster_tutorial|. There you can learn, step by step, how
TaskBuster has been done, and even do it yourself if you want to!!

To start using the Boilerplate, check out the :doc:`requirements`
and next the :doc:`quick_start`.

Also, setup for codeship. Hypothesis is that when a pull request is made,
after it is looked over and merged, Codeship CI will run the full suite of
tests to make sure they pass before actually merging.

Starting second test where I will purposefully make the build fail and see if
Codeship prevents the code from being added to the central repo.
